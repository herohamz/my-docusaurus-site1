# AI Humanoid Guide

AI humanoids are intelligent machines designed to look, move, and interact like humans.
They combine artificial intelligence, robotics, sensors, and human-inspired design to
perform tasks in real-world environments.

This guide provides a structured and easy-to-understand explanation of AI humanoid systems,
covering their history, intelligence, physical design, ethical concerns, and future
possibilities.

The goal of this book is to help students, developers, and beginners understand how
humanoid robots work and how artificial intelligence enables human-like behavior.
