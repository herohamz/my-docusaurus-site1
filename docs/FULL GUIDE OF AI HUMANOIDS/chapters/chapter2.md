# Chapter 2: Artificial Intelligence in Humanoids

Artificial intelligence is the core of a humanoid robot. It enables the robot to understand,
learn, and make decisions instead of following fixed instructions.

## Perception Systems

AI humanoids use perception systems to understand their surroundings:
- Computer vision for recognizing objects and faces
- Speech recognition for understanding spoken language
- Sensor data processing for touch and balance

## Decision Making

Once information is perceived, AI systems analyze it using:
- Rule-based logic
- Machine learning models
- Neural networks for complex reasoning

These systems help humanoids decide how to respond to different situations.

## Learning Capabilities

Humanoid robots can improve over time using:
- Supervised learning (learning from examples)
- Reinforcement learning (learning through trial and feedback)
- Deep learning (handling complex patterns and behaviors)

AI allows humanoids to adapt, making them more useful and intelligent over time.
