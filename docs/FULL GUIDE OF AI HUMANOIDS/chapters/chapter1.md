# Chapter 1: Introduction to AI Humanoids

AI humanoids are robots that resemble the human body and behavior while being powered by
artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional machines, humanoids are designed to interact
naturally with humans using speech, gestures, facial expressions, and movement.

## What Makes a Robot a Humanoid?

A robot is considered a humanoid when it has:
- A human-like body structure (head, torso, arms, legs)
- The ability to walk or move in a human-inspired way
- Sensors that allow perception of the environment
- AI systems that enable decision-making and learning

## Purpose of AI Humanoids

Humanoid robots are built to:
- Assist humans in daily tasks
- Work in environments designed for humans
- Communicate naturally using language and expressions
- Learn from interaction and experience

## Examples of AI Humanoids

Some well-known humanoid robots include:
- ASIMO (mobility and balance)
- Pepper (social interaction)
- Atlas (advanced movement and agility)

AI humanoids represent the convergence of robotics and artificial intelligence, aiming
to create machines that can coexist and collaborate with humans.
