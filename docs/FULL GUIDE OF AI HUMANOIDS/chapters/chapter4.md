# Chapter 4: Human Interaction and Ethics

As humanoid robots interact more closely with humans, ethical considerations become
extremely important.

## Human-Robot Interaction

AI humanoids communicate using:
- Speech and language
- Gestures and body movement
- Facial expressions and emotional cues

Natural interaction increases trust and usability.

## Ethical Concerns

Key ethical issues include:
- Privacy of user data
- Safety in human environments
- Dependence on robots
- Impact on employment

## Responsible Development

To ensure safe use:
- AI systems must follow strict safety rules
- Decision-making should be transparent
- Robots should always remain under human control

Ethics ensures that humanoids serve humanity positively.
