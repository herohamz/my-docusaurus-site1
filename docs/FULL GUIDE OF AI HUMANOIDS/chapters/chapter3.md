# Chapter 3: Robotics and Physical Design

The physical structure of an AI humanoid enables it to move and interact with the real world.

## Mechanical Structure

Humanoid robots are built with:
- A skeletal frame for support
- Joints that mimic human movement
- Motors and actuators that control motion

## Sensors and Feedback

Sensors provide real-time feedback, including:
- Cameras for vision
- Gyroscopes for balance
- Touch sensors for safe interaction

## Movement and Balance

Walking is one of the most challenging tasks for humanoids.
AI algorithms constantly adjust posture and movement to maintain balance and stability.

The combination of mechanics and AI allows humanoids to perform human-like actions safely.
